Representing Faculty of Social Science, Prof. Travis NG delivered a talk on *Virtual Regional Fair 2020* on 12 Dec, 2020. The Fair was an event held by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, aiming to provide admission information for high-school students. 

 The talk, titled "The Social Scientific Nature of Business Organisations", was to look at business organisations from a social science perspective. Business organisations are about more than just business. They evolve to solve people's problems; and they solve them beautifully. Their profit motives, legal statuses as stand-alone entities beyond people who found and run them, limited liabilities, transferability of ownership, public listing, etc., are the evolutionary results after billions of trials and errors to resolve conflicts of interest among us people. Understanding them represents an indispensable part of understanding our society.
